### SelectUSA Going Global Seminars in France

From March 15-23, we will hold regional seminars for French companies and investors that are looking to expand in the United States. The seminars will be held in Rennes, Lyon, Marseille and Nice. Each program, titled "Going Global - Formulating Your Company's Investment in the United States," will feature insight and presentations from representatives of the U.S. Embassy in France, including SelectUSA's Marie-Josee Andrieu, and French business leaders. Attendees will hear about how to successfully establish their U.S. investments, the visa process, a case study on French companies that have thrived in the United States, the upcoming Investment Summit in June, and the benefits of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) for French companies.
