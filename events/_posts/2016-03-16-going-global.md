### SelectUSA Going Global Seminar

On March 16, we will hold a seminar for French companies and investors that are looking to expand in the United States. The seminar, "Going Global - Formulating Your Company's Investment in the United States" will feature insight and presentations from representatives of the U.S. Embassy in France, including SelectUSA's Marie-Josee Andrieu, and French business leaders. Attendees will hear about how to successfully establish their U.S. investments, the visa process, a case study on French companies that have thrived in the United States, and the upcoming Investment Summit in June.
