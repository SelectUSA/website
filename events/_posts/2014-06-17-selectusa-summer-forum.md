### Keynote Speaker: Jeff Fettig, CEO of Whirlpool

&nbsp;

<span class="imgeventleft">![Image of Jeff Fettig](../images/jeff-206x261.png "Jeff Fettig")</span>
We were thrilled to have Mr. Jeff Fettig, CEO
        of Whirlpool, joining us to share his experience with reshoring.
        &nbsp;Eighty percent of Whirlpool products on the U.S. market are made
        right here in the United States.

&nbsp;

Nowhere is this more evident than
        Clyde, Ohio – home to the largest washing machine factory in the world.
        &nbsp; Whirlpool recently announced that it would move the production
        of a line of front-load commercial washers from abroad to Clyde, adding
        new jobs locally. &nbsp;This is just the latest in a series of
        investments that the company has been making across the country.

&nbsp;

## "Whirlpool has complete confidence in the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing" &nbsp;- &nbsp;Jeff Fettig, CEO, Whirlpool
