### SelectUSA Seminars in Italy

Italy and the United States have strong economic ties. **Italian foreign direct investment (FDI) stock in the U.S. [exceeds $28 billion](http://selectusa.commerce.gov/country-fact-sheets/Italy_Fact_Sheet.pdf)** and **124,700 U.S. workers are employed by Italian-owned firms.** Those firms contribute **$24.6 billion to U.S. exports** and **over $2.3 billion to research and development spending** in the United States.

On February 17th, we will hold a seminar in Milan and travel on to Florence the following day. Organized in cooperation with two major local industrial associations, the events will promote the [2016 Investment Summit](http://selectusasummit.us/) and connect potential investors with individual U.S. economic development organizations. Attendees will hear about case studies from Italian companies that have successfully invested in the United States.
