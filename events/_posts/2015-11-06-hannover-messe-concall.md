Do you work for a U.S. economic development organization? Are you wondering whether you should participate in [Hannover Messe 2016](http://trade.gov/events/hannovermesse/), the worldâ€™s largest trade show for industrial goods, technology, and R&D? The United States will be the official Partner Country, and we are ready to help you take advantage of this rare opportunity.

**Join us on Friday, November 6th at 10:00 a.m. EST for a conference call!**

**What is the call about?** We will focus on the U.S. Investment Pavilion. We will also discuss ways EDOs can work with us to support local exporters and research/technology organizations.

**Who should join the call?** U.S. economic development organizations

**Why join the call on Nov. 6th?** Hannover Messe may not be until April, but the U.S. Investment Pavilion is filling up. Space is reserved for U.S. EDOs until November 30th.  After that, the remaining space will open to other exhibitors.  Register soon to make the most of this opportunity.

USA Partner Country status means more exposure than ever for showcasing your locations! You'll be able to connect directly with more than 200,000 attendees across industry sectors. The U.S. Partner Country presence will feature a [24,000 sq. ft. Investment Pavilion for EDOs and SelectUSA](http://selectusa.commerce.gov/events/selectusa-hannover-messe-2016.html), and eight (8) U.S. Industry Pavilions for U.S. SMEs.
