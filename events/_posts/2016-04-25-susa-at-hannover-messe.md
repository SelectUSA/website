[Hannover Messe](http://www.hannovermesse.de/home) is and has long been the largest industrial trade show in the world and one of the premier event platforms to spark international business opportunities. The greatest and most-advanced manufacturing technologies are showcased and economic development growth is facilitated. This upcoming April, SelectUSA will head the U.S. Investment Pavilion, and, for the first time ever, the United States will be the official Partner Country of trade show. President Obama will also become the [first sitting U.S. president to attend](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/12/30/statement-press-secretary-presidents-travel-germany) the trade show when he opens Hannover Messe with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

As [Partner Country](http://www.hannovermesse.de/en/program/partner-country/), the United States will attract unique and focused attention from the international business, manufacturing, and media communities. U.S. exhibitors will have the highest amount of exposure to over 200,000 visitors and thousands of journalists and bloggers, as well as 6,000 other economic development and industrial exhibitors from 27 exhibit halls.

Hannover Messe 2016 will present U.S. economic development organizations with golden opportunities to attract FDI to their states, territories, and regions. There will be increased visibility, signage, and TV and press coverage accompanying the seminars and discussions.
