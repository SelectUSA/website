## Japan Road Show

**Join the SelectUSA Japan Road Show!** Japan and the United States have [one of the strongest and most interconnected trade and economic relationships in the world](http://selectusa.commerce.gov/country-fact-sheets/2015-09-10 Japan Fact Sheet.pdf). Nearly 13 percent of all FDI into the United States comes from Japan – **over $374 billion** – and **over 718,000 U.S. workers are employed by Japanese-owned firms.** Those firms contribute **$67.6 billion to U.S. exports and over $6 billion to research and development spending** in the United States.  

On February 1st, SelectUSA, in cooperation with the U.S. Commercial Service Japan and the U.S. consulates in Nagoya and Fukuoka, will begin the Japan Road Show in Tokyo. Over the following days in Nagoya, Osaka, and Fukuoka, the seminars will focus on the U.S. legal and regulatory systems, investment visas, and case studies. On February 2nd, a special event is planned for investors to meet with EDOs to discuss specific investment projects and opportunities. Networking receptions after the seminars will give U.S. economic development organizations (EDOs) the opportunity to meet one-on-one with Japanese investors. 

**Space will be limited to approximately 100 participants per seminar so don’t miss your chance to join us!**
