## Join the SelectUSA Japan Road Show!

Japan and the United States have [one of the strongest and most interconnected trade and economic relationships in the world](http://selectusa.commerce.gov/country-fact-sheets/2015-09-10 Japan Fact Sheet.pdf). Nearly 13 percent of all FDI into the United States comes from Japan – **over $374 billion** – and **over 718,000 U.S. workers are employed by Japanese-owned firms.** Those firms contribute **$67.6 billion to U.S. exports and over $6 billion to research and development spending** in the United States.  

On February 1st, SelectUSA will begin the Japan Road Show in Tokyo, traveling on to Nagoya, Osaka, and Fukuoka. Seminars for investors will focus on the U.S. legal and regulatory systems, investment visas, and case studies. More details on events, networking opportunities, and one-on-one meetings between investors and U.S. economic developers will be shared soon.
