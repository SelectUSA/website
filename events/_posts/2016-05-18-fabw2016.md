### SelectUSA at French American Business Week

On May 18-19, 2016, the French American Chamber of Commerce will host the first-ever "French American Business Week" at the French Embassy in Washington, D.C. This event is geared toward the high level executives of both private organizations and government agencies and will focus on how the United States and France can strengthen bilateral trade and investment.

The event will consist of conferences, workshops, and a trade show for French and U.S. firms and institutions, where they will be able to promote their organizations and showcase their industry knowledge and expertise with other participants. Specialized networking opportunities will be included over the course of both days.

SelectUSA will be there to explain the services and resources available to French companies that plan to expand into the U.S. market. Investment Specialist Nathan Regan will brief participants on how they can utilize these unique services.
