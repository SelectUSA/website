### UNCTAD/BEA FDI Numbers Conference Call

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) published its [Global Investment Trends Monitor Report](http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/webdiaeia2016d1_en.pdf) on 2015 foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, which analyszes FDI flows between countries and regions. The report reveals that flows into the United States increased to $384 billion, more than any other country and a record high. The United States remains the [leading destination for investment](http://blog.trade.gov/2016/03/03/new-report-global-fdi-flows-show-continued-confidence-in-u-s-economy/).

* UNCTAD's recent report on global flows (_What does $384 billion mean?_)
* The International Trade Administration's report on the [impact of FDI on U.S. employment](http://blog.trade.gov/2016/02/24/new-study-how-important-is-fdi-to-the-u-s-economy/), which found that 12 million jobs, or 8.5 percent of the entire U.S. labor force, were attributable to FDI (_How does FDI create those jobs?_)
* BEA's highly anticipated release of [more detailed data on FDI in the United States](http://blog.trade.gov/2015/12/03/u-s-remains-no-1-choice-for-foreign-investment-new-stats-released/), including statistics on both greenfield and acquisitions. (_How can you make sense of that?_)
