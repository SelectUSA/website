# SelectUSA India Road Show

Join the first-ever India SelectUSA Roadshow! This four-city Road Show to **New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata** will offer U.S. state, local and regional economic development organizations (EDOs) the opportunity to **market their locations directly to potential investors** throughout India.

Each Road Show stop will feature a **half-day seminar** with sessions on how to invest and expand in the United States. The proposed seminars will attract approximately 120 senior executives in each city and include content about investment visas, legal and financial issues, investment opportunities and successful investment strategies. Along with scheduled **networking sessions**, there will be ample opportunity for attendees to visit your **exhibit** at the event.

**India is the fourth fastest growing source of FDI into the United States.** Hundreds of dynamic companies are headquartered in the Road Show stops, and many of these companies are looking to invest in the United States. Top U.S. government officials, including leaders in the Department of Commerce and SelectUSA, has made multiple visits to India and welcomed a [high-quality delegation of Indian investors](https://www.flickr.com/photos/selectusa/17608354832/in/photolist-aF4ige-aF4igK-aF4igt-aF4igp-aF4igz-sPZqqG-a3cFbC) to our 2015 SelectUSA Investment Summit. **The pump is primed for Indian investment into your region, and this road show is a great opportunity to meet investors face-to-face**.
