##Save the Date: SelectUSA Silk Road China Road Show!

China is the fastest growing source of foreign direct investment to the United States and the worldâ€™s second largest economy. On January 13-20, U.S. economic developers will have the chance to meet with Chinese investors in Beijing, Urumqi, and Chengdu. Programming will vary by city and exact venues as well as more details will be announced soon. Space will be limited and once registration starts, it will be on a first-come, first-served basis.

For more information, please contact [Shujuan Cao](Shujuan.cao@trade.gov) in China or [John McKiel](john.mckiel@trade.gov) in Washington, DC.
