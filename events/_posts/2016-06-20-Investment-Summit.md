## What Happened at the 2015 Summit?

By all accounts, the [2015 SelectUSA Investment Summit](http://selectusa.commerce.gov/2015-summit.html) hosted by President Barack Obama on March 23-24 was a tremendous success for the United States and the entrepreneurs who invest in our communities.

We welcomed close to 2,600 participants to Washington this March from more than 70 international markets, including companies and business associations, as well as EDOs from all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Global CEOs and other business leaders representing major international firms such as BMW, Google, Nissan, Sony, and many more joined entrepreneurs at the Summit who have successfully grown their startups and SMEs in the United States.

Participants of our last Summit announced approximately $3.6 billion in new U.S. investments, supporting an estimated 7,779 U.S. jobs, according to data compiled by *fDi Markets* through September 2015.
