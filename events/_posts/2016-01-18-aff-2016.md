[The 9th Asian Financial Forum (AFF)](http://www.asianfinancialforum.com/en/index.htm) brings together some of the most influential members of the global financial and business community to discuss developments and trends in the dynamic markets of Asia. This ninth Asian Financial Forum has adopted as its theme “Asia: Shaping the New Paradigm for Growth”. In 2015, over 100 internationally respected leaders in government, financial and business sectors gathered for groundbreaking discussions about opportunities and challenges facing Asia.
 The eighth AFF attracted more than 2,600 participants from 39 countries and regions. About 85% of them were CEOs and senior decision makers. They were joined by over 500 journalists and media representatives.

### U.S. Participation at the Forum

To showcase the United States as a premier destination for investment, the U.S. Commercial Service is hosting a SelectUSA booth in the Global Investment Zone. We invite interested U.S. economic development organizations (EDOs) that seek to attract investment and have concrete investment projects to join us. Participating EDOs will be hosted at our booth.

 On January 19, there is a [DealFlow session](http://www.asianfinancialforum.com/en/info_deal.htm) covering the second day of the AFF. One-to-one meetings are arranged between sources of funds and sources of deals, enabling you to meet with potential business partners from around the world, based on their shared areas of interest.
