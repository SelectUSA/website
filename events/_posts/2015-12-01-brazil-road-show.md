Brazil is of the top ten major economies in the world, and also ranks within the **top 10 fastest growing investors in the United States**. With a territory the size of the continental USA, Brazil presents a **diversified economy with well-developed industrial and services sectors**, ranging from aerospace multinationals and IT start-ups to sophisticated financial companies.

Brazilian companies have been exposed to the international market for almost 25 years now (after the market opened in 1992),  and **internationalization of operations is a hot topic** in the business community.

The **SelectUSA Road Show in Brazil** will stop by the three major cities in the country, exposing EDOs to companies in a wide range of sectors such as Oil & Gas, Manufacturing, Mining, ICT, Life Sciences, and Finance.

Please stay tuned for more details as we draw closer to the event!
