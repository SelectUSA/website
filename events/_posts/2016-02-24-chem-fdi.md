### SelectUSA Chemical Industries FDI Seminar

In partnership with Essenscia (the Beligian Federation for Chemistry and Life Sciences Industries) and the U.S. Embassy in Belgium, SelectUSA will host a half-day seminar on February 24, 2016.

The seminar will open with remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Denise Bauer and a senior Belgian government representative. Following their introduction and remarks, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers Association will hold a U.S. market overview, followed by a panel discussion with Beligian investors in the United States. SelectUSA will then brief participants on federal services for investors. After the seminar there will be a networking lunch.
