The Japan Road Show is fast approaching (February 1-5, 2016) and we want to help U.S. economic developers connect with investors from the second largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the United States. Please join us for a conference call on the Japan Road Show on Thursday, December 3rd, at 4 p.m. EST / 1 p.m. PST. We will discuss the focus of the four-city road show and how U.S. economic development organizations can participate.
 
On the morning of the call, December 3rd, registered parties will receive background materials that will be discussed during the call.

To register for the conference call, please contact [Micah Escobedo](micah.escobedo@trade.gov).
