### SelectUSA Manufacturing Forum at the Canadian International Auto Show (CIAS)

Join us for the new edition of the annual SelectUSA Manufacturing Forum at the [Canadian International Auto Show (CIAS)](http://autoshow.ca/) in Toronto. Designed by the U.S. Commerce Service (USCS) Toronto, the event will feature companies from the Canadian automotive and advanced manufacturing technology sectors. U.S. Economic Development Organizations (EDOs) will be able to meet with Canadian investors, hear about manufacturing from U.S. Government officials, gain access to the exclusive CIAS Opening Day, and take advantage of networking opportunities.  

Canada is the 4th largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States: $311 billion USD (2014). Check out more FDI from Canada information from our [fact sheet](http://selectusa.commerce.gov/country-fact-sheets/Canada_Fact_Sheet.pdf).
