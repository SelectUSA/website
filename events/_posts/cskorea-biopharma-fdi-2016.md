### SelectUSA Korea Biopharma FDI Promotion Event

On March 30, we will partner with the U.S. Commercial Service (CS) to hold the Korea Biopharma FDI Promotion Event in Seoul, South Korea. This one-day seminar will offer U.S. economic development organizations (EDOs) an opportunity to market their locations directly to Korean biopharma investors.

The seminar will provide technical information to Korean biopharma firms regarding FDA approval and other regulatory considerations needed to successfully do business in the United States. We will then highlight biopharma business climates and opportunities in the United States. This event is expected to draw more than 80 Korean executives and corporate strategic business planners in the biopharma industry and multipliers.


As a SelectUSA seminar participant, you will recieve:

* The opportunity to **present and promote investment opportunities in your region**
* A **Display table** to showcase your promotional materials
* **Meeting and networking opportunities** with companies and multipliers in the Korean market
* **On-site counseling and support** by professional CS Korea and SelectUSA staff. 
* **Entry in the printed 2016 SelectUSA Korea Biopharma catalogue** and electronic EDO catalog
* **Logistics Assistance** through the identification of hotels and flights that best meet the schedule of the event
