SelectUSA, in collaboration with the United States Commercial Service (USCS) Israel and the American State Offices Assocation (ASOA), will head a special catalog show in Tel Aviv on January 20, 2016. This is a great opportunity for localities with no representation in Israel to showcase and introduce the benefits of their markets to investors. SelectUSA will have a designated table -- in addition to participants' own tables -- where participants' informational materials will be promoted to attendees of the show. 

**The participation fee is $300. Up to 60 copies of promotional literature, brochures, etc. must be sent by January 10, 2016.**
