<p>The Commercial Service (CS) Western Japan, in collaboration with the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), will organize a <strong>“U.S. Business Seminar” in Takamatsu on July 16, 2015 and Hiroshima on July 17, 2015</strong>, promoting foreign direct investment (FDI) from Japan to the United States. We invite U.S. Economic Development Organizations and service providers to participate in this seminar series to <strong>promote your region and services to interested Japanese companies.</strong></p>

<p>Hiroshima and Takamatsu are major cities in the Chugoku and Shikoku regions. The Chugoku region consists of five prefectures, Hiroshima, Okayama, Yamaguchi, Tottori and Shimane, while the Shikoku region consists of four prefectures, Kagawa, Ehime, Tokushima and Kochi prefectures. <strong>These regions are home to many excellent small and medium sized companies with unique technologies.</strong> For example, Nichia in Tokushima is the world’s largest supplier of LEDs, and Nippura in Kagawa is a manufacturer of acrylic glass panel for aquariums with a world market share of about 70%.</p>
