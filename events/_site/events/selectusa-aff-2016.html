<a href="http://www.asianfinancialforum.com/en/index.htm">The 9th Asian Financial Forum (AFF)</a> brings together some of the most influential members of the global financial and business community to discuss developments and trends in the dynamic markets of Asia. This ninth Asian Financial Forum has adopted as its theme “Asia: Shaping the New Paradigm for Growth”. In 2015, over 100 internationally respected leaders in government, financial and business sectors gathered for groundbreaking discussions about opportunities and challenges facing Asia.
 The eighth AFF attracted more than 2,600 participants from 39 countries and regions. About 85% of them were CEOs and senior decision makers. They were joined by over 500 journalists and media representatives.</p>
