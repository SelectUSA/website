We were thrilled to have Mr. Jeff Fettig, CEO
        of Whirlpool, joining us to share his experience with reshoring.
         Eighty percent of Whirlpool products on the U.S. market are made
        right here in the United States.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Nowhere is this more evident than
        Clyde, Ohio – home to the largest washing machine factory in the world.
          Whirlpool recently announced that it would move the production
        of a line of front-load commercial washers from abroad to Clyde, adding
        new jobs locally.  This is just the latest in a series of
        investments that the company has been making across the country.</p>
