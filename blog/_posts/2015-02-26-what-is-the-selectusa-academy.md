The [**2015 SelectUSA Investment Summit**](http://www.selectusasummit.com/) is fast approaching and the excitement around it continues to build. To date, there are more than 2,100 registrants from almost 80 international markets and nearly every U.S. state. The Summit will bring together high-profile business leaders, investors, state and local representatives, and government officials to network and discuss the latest investment trends.

New this year is an important addition for participants who are looking to make the most of their Summit experience: **The SelectUSA Academy**.

The Academy is an intensive, practical pre-Summit orientation that will give **companies, state and local governments, and economic developments organizations** (EDOs) the basics on investing in the U.S. market and strategies to attract investment to their locations.

The sessions will offer **indispensable** **analytical** **tools and information** to help participants navigate regulations and investment incentives, investor visas, current foreign direct investment (FDI) and reshoring trends, and more—see the [**Academy agenda**](http://www.selectusasummit.com/agenda) for more details on the sessions and speakers.

You can participate in the Academy in two different tracks:

1.  The **Investor Track** is designed for potential investors and companies of all sizes who want to learn the basics of investing in the United States.
2.  The **EDO Track** is tailored to state/local governments and EDOs looking to develop specific strategies for attracting FDI and discuss the latest trends and resources in economic development.

Participants in the SelectUSA Academy will not only **gain** **valuable, first-hand insight** from experienced investors, economic developers, and government officials to boost their investment strategies, but they will also have a chance to meet and mingle the night before the Summit. Following the Academy sessions, there will be a **special** **networking reception** on Sunday evening for all Academy participants and speakers.
