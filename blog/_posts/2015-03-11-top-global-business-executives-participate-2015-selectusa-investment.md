Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a
critical role in the U.S. economy, which is why President Obama launched
SelectUSA, the first-ever U.S. government-wide initiative to promote and
facilitate investment into the United States.&nbsp;Through 2014, SelectUSA
helped generate more than $20 billion&nbsp;of investments in the United States,
investments that have been instrumental in creating jobs and spurring economic
growth. In 2014, 5.8 million people in the United States were employed by U.S.
subsidiaries of foreign firms.

The SelectUSA Investment Summit will be
held at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center just outside
Washington, D.C. The event is nearly at capacity, with 2,500 people from nearly
80 countries registered—doubling the size of the inaugural Summit that was held
in 2013.&nbsp; More than 30 U.S. ambassadors are personally leading delegations
to this year’s Summit, up from three ambassadorial delegations in 2013,
reflecting growing interest in this event. To learn more about the SelectUSA
