The U.S. Department of
Commerce announced today that Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of the
Treasury Jacob J. Lew, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, Secretary of Labor
Thomas Perez, Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, and U.S. Trade
Representative Michael Froman will join Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker at
the [2015
SelectUSA Investment Summit](http://www.selectusasummit.com/) on March 23-24 at the Gaylord National
Resort and Convention Center, just outside Washington, D.C.&nbsp;

“Our goal at the SelectUSA Summit is to
promote the United States as the premier destination for international
investment and ensure that companies worldwide know America is open for
business,” said Secretary Pritzker. “There has never been a better time to
establish or expand operations in the United States, and we are undertaking an
Administration-wide effort to bring new job-creating investment to the U.S.
that will generate economic growth for years to come.”

Additional
high-ranking White House officials include Jeff Zients, Director of the
National Economic Council and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy;
Megan Smith, Chief Technology Officer and Assistant to the President; and
Caroline Atkinson, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National
Security Advisor for International Economics.&nbsp;

To
date, more than 2,100 people from nearly 80 countries have registered for the
Summit, and more than 30 U.S. ambassadors are personally leading delegations.
The inaugural 2013 SelectUSA Investment Summit attracted more than 1,300
participants including investors from 60 countries. President Obama addressed
the first summit, along with senior administration officials and 64 top public
and private-sector representatives.&nbsp;

Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a
critical role in the U.S. economy, which is why President Obama launched
SelectUSA, the first-ever U.S. government-wide initiative to promote and
facilitate investment in the United States.&nbsp;Through 2014, SelectUSA helped
generate more than $20 billion&nbsp;of investments, creating jobs and spurring
economic growth. In 2014, 5.8 million people in the United States were employed
by U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms.&nbsp;
