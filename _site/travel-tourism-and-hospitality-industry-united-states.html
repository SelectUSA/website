<h2>The U.S. Travel, Tourism, and Hospitality Industry</h2>

<p><img src="images/travel1.jpg" alt="American flag on a road sign in the prairie" /></p>

<p>The travel and tourism industry in
the United States generated nearly $1.5 trillion in economic output in 2012.
This activity supported 7.8 million U.S. jobs, and accounted for 7 percent of
all U.S. exports. One out of every 17 Americans works, either directly or
indirectly, in a travel or tourism-related industry. In 2011 U.S. travel and
tourism output represented 2.8 percent of gross domestic product.</p>

<p>While the majority of activity in
the industry is domestic, expenditures by international visitors in the United
States generated nearly $166 billion in sales and a more than $47 billion trade
surplus in 2012.&nbsp;The U.S. Department of Commerce projects international
travel to the United States should grow by 3 percent annually through 2018. The
U.S. leads the world in international travel and tourism exports, and travel
and tourism is the top services export, accounting for 25 percent of all U.S.
services exports. &nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Industry Subsectors</strong></h2>

<p>Of the more than 25 subsectors that make up the travel and tourism industry, three sectors -- food services, air travel, and accommodations -- account for more than 50 percent of total output.</p>

<p><img src="images/travel2.jpg" alt="restaurant" />&nbsp;<strong>Accommodations:</strong> This subsector is the largest of the three and accounts for
19 percent of total travel industry output. Accommodations benefited from
international overseas traveler growth of 7 percent in 2012.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Food Services:</strong> This subsector is the second largest and accounts for more
than 16 percent of travel and tourism-related output. The National Restaurant
Association predicts 3.5 percent growth for the restaurant industry in
2012.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Air Travel: </strong>This subsector accounts for nearly16 percent of travel
industry output. Airlines continuously seek ways to increase revenue by
offering access to new markets as they work to reduce costs and fuel
consumption by grounding inefficient aircraft and scaling back unprofitable routes.</p>

<h2><strong>Federal Resources</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Travel Promotion Act of 2009 (TPA):</strong>&nbsp;This Act established the Corporation
for Travel Promotion (CTP), a new public-private partnership in travel and
tourism. The alliance between the U.S. government and the U.S. travel and
tourism industry enhances the distribution of information on U.S. entry
policies and promotes leisure, business, and scholarly travel to and within the
United States. &nbsp;Currently, under the Travel Promotion Act, the CTP can
access up to $100 million in federal matching funds to execute its mission
based on a 1 to 1 ratio of public to private funds. The CTP is active in the
top international travel markets for the United States and is doing business as
Brand USA. &nbsp;</p>
