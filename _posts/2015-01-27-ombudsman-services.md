Working with SelectUSA, investors can develop a better understanding of how to navigate the U.S. regulatory environment.

###Who May Use This Service:
A request for ombudsman assistance may come from either a company who has questions or concerns about a federal rule or regulation or from an economic development organization working with a company who has such questions or concerns. 

###How to Request Ombudsman Service:
To request assistance, please [Contact Us](mailto:info@selectusa.gov) via e-mail or call +1-202-482-6800. A SelectUSA team member will follow up with you, immediately.

###What Happens Next:
You will be contacted by a member of the SelectUSA team member to obtain detailed information regarding your question or concern, and to discuss suggested steps to assist you.  SelectUSA often engages members of the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group (IIWG), which coordinates interagency activities to promote business investment and responds to specific federal regulatory issues that may impact business investment decisions.  The IIWG is convened and chaired by the SelectUSA Executive Director, in coordination with the Director of the National Economic Council.

The SelectUSA ombudsman service is conducted within the standards of practice set forth by the International Ombudsman Association and is cognizant of business sensitive information.

In all interactions, SelectUSA operates in a geographically neutral manner.
