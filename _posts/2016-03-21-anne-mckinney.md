Ms. McKinney has more than 20 years of experience working on international trade, investment and economic development issues. Previously, she served as the Deputy Executive Director of the Colombian American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham Colombia) in Bogotá, where for nearly seven years she worked closely with leading U.S. and Colombian companies and helped advance the chamber’s policy agenda on a wide range of trade, investment, regulatory and sustainable development issues.
