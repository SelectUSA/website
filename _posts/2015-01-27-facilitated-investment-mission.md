SelectUSA leverages the [U.S. Foreign Commercial Service (USFCS) network across 72 countries](http://export.gov/eac/) to provide U.S. economic development organizations and jurisdictions with unique international promotion opportunities and access to potential investors.&nbsp; SelectUSA conducts Facilitated Investment Missions (FIMs), designed as a platform where multiple U.S. states, local or regional governments and economic development organizations (EDOs) can connect with foreign firms interested in learning about investment opportunities in the United States. FIMs are often organized as “Invest in the United States” seminars, road shows with multiple venues, or a targeted event alongside a larger industry trade show or conference. FIMs offer participants with market insights, investor connections, one-on-one business appointments, and networking events. 

Depending on demand, a FIM may be offered as a fee-based service on a first-come-first-serve basis.
