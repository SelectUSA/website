U.S. cities, states, and regions have a strong legacy of pursuing and winning business investment projects. SelectUSA helps level the playing field for U.S. EDOs competing with foreign locations for investment projects. With SelectUSA, EDOs now have an advocate at the national level to help attract, retain, and grow investment in the United States.

###Who May Use This Service:
Advocacy assistance can be requested by a Governor, Mayor, or County Executive of a jurisdiction in global business location competitions against foreign jurisdictions. The request for advocacy may also be initiated by an economic development organization.

###How to Request Advocacy Service:
To request advocacy assistance, please [Contact Us](mailto:info@selectusa.gov) via email or call +1-202-482-6800. A SelectUSA team member will follow up with you within two (2) business days.

###What Happens Next:
SelectUSA will coordinate the U.S. Government approach to provide the U.S. state or region with the appropriate level of advocacy assistance. SelectUSA can also request the engagement of senior leadership from across the U.S. Government to make the case directly to the company.

In all interactions, SelectUSA operates in a geographically neutral manner.
