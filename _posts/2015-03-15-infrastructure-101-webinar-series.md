#### Introducing the Build America Investment Initiative

The [Build America Investment Initiative](http://www.dot.gov/buildamerica) is&nbsp;a U.S. government-wide initiative to increase infrastructure investment and economic growth by engaging with state and local governments and private sector investors to encourage collaboration, expand&nbsp;the market for public-private partnerships (PPPs), and put federal credit programs to greater use. This initiative will harness the potential of private capital to complement government funding. 

Several states and communities have established successful PPPs and have developed strong institutional knowledge of how these projects are best structured and managed.&nbsp;Federal agencies are helping to transfer that know-how to other states, providing tools and models, and increasing access to federal loan programs and resources. Working together, state and local governments, the federal government and the private sector can increase the flow of capital by tens of billions of dollars over the next few years.<span>&nbsp;</span>

The [Build America Investment Initiative](http://www.dot.gov/buildamerica) will use the lessons learned from leading states and localities to help other communities and private project sponsors understand and better use federal financing programs, and to structure deals that incorporate best practices and avoid pitfalls.

## <a name="Inf103"></a>_Infrastructure 103 Webinar with USDA_ 

#### <span style="font-size: 1em;">January 28, 2015 at 2 pm EST</span>

**Mr. Matt McKenna**, Senior Advisor to the Secretary on Strategic Partnerships, continued the discussion in our P3 100-series of webinars about the President’s **Build America Investment Initiative**, focusing on opportunities for infrastructure investments in rural America.&nbsp; USDA currently manages a portfolio of **over $200 Billion of rural economic development loans**. Their programs include utilities, housing, renewable energy, community facilities, business and industry and other local investments. The USDA has identified a barrier to private investment in these programs which is the scale and small size of most of their loans. They are working to bring these programs to scale by **bundling these assets to attract third party investments**. In addition, the USDA has formed the **Rural Opportunity Investment Initiative** whose sole mission is to partner both inside and outside of government to attract incremental financial resources to rural America.&nbsp;
