### *Reinvesting in America, Creating Jobs at Home*

**June 17, 2014**

Co-hosted by **Congressman Frank Wolf**, the [SelectUSA Summer Forum]({{ site.baseurl }}{{post.url}}/events/selectusa-summer-forum.html) covered a wide range of perspectives on what's driving reshoring, the challenges that lie ahead, and best practices. Like foreign direct investment, when U.S. companies recognize the value in expanding or repatriating their U.S. operations, local communities benefit and the economy grows stronger.

Keynote speakers included **U.S.&nbsp;Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker** and **Whirlpool CEO Jeff Fettig.** We also heard from leading economists, Walmart, economic development organizations, and companies that shared their experience in making the move back to the United States.

If you missed it, you can still check out the presentations,&nbsp;[available online]({{ site.baseurl }}{{post.url}}/events/selectusa-summer-forum.html).
