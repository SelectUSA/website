**Top government and industry speakers** will discuss the dynamics and trends of the U.S. aerospace manufacturing industry. Confirmed speakers include senior officials from the U.S. Departments of Commerce, Defense, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as senior industry representatives (including Barry Eccleston, the President of Airbus Americas).

Attendees can also participate in **small group workshops with federal agency representatives** on topics such as FAA regulations, research and development in the United States, and contracting with the Department of Defense.

Through **matchmaking meetings** arranged by the Expo organizers, investors can meet one-on-one with economic developers and officials to explore opportunities and learn about resources and incentives. There will be plenty of time for participant networking and ad hoc meetings as well.
