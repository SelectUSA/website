For **U.S. state and local economic development organizations,** the Expo is a great chance to showcase your location's aerospace-related opportunities in the Exhibition Hall and attract new investments to your community or region.

Service providers, aerospace suppliers, and associations can also take advantage of the Expo to increase their brand awareness, attract new clients, and solidify existing business. 

You can view the wide range of **advertising, exhibitor, and sponsorship** opportunities below, and see the [current list of exhibitors and sponsors](http://aeroinvestmentexpo.com/sponsors-exhibitors/current-sponsors) on the official Expo website.

## Ad and Exhibitor Opportunities

As an **exhibitor at the Expo** ($5,000), your organization will receive an 8'x10' booth in the Exhibition Hall, two complimentary Expo registrations, a half-page ad in the Expo program, your logo displayed on the Expo website, and a two-year membership to the Aerospace States Association. Larger booth areas can be purchased for $2,500 per additional 8’x10’ space.

Organizations and service providers can also **advertise in the Expo program** without purchasing a booth, with rates ranging from $100 for a three-line recognition (with logo) to $2,000 for two full pages in the program. More details on all five advertising levels can be found in the flyer below.
