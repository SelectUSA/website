The U.S. Department of Commerce is partnering with the [Aerospace States Association](http://aerostates.org/) to host the first-ever [National Aerospace FDI Exposition](http://aeroinvestmentexpo.com/) on **October 26-28, 2015 in Los Angeles, California**.

The Expo will bring foreign investors together with U.S. companies, economic development organizations, state officials, and service providers to showcase the **investment opportunities in the U.S. aerospace manufacturing sector**.

This event is not just for aerospace companies—it’s also a great opportunity for smaller firms to learn how they can better integrate into the aerospace supply chain in the United States.
