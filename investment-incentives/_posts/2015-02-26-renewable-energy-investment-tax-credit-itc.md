<H2>Renewable Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) </h2>
<P><STRONG>Department of the Treasury </strong></p>
<P><STRONG>Internal Revenue Service</strong></p>
<P><STRONG>Incentive:</strong> The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) reduces federal income taxes for qualified tax-paying owners based on capital investment in renewable energy projects (measured in dollars). The ITC generally allows taxpayers to take a single tax credit against the project's tax basis equal to 30% in its first year and allows a taxpayer to elect certain qualified facilities to be characterized as energy property eligible for a 10% or 30% ITC, depending on the technology.</p>
<P>Incentives depend on the type of energy. Fuel cells can receive a $1500 credit per 0.5 kW.</p>
<P><STRONG>Eligibility:</strong> Wind, closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal, solar, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower production, marine &amp; hydrokinetic renewable energy.</p>
<P><STRONG>When:</strong> System must be placed in service between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2012. Certain geothermal and open- or closed- loop biomass systems qualify through December 31, 2013.</p>
