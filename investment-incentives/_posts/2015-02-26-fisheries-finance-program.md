<P><STRONG>Incentive:</strong> The Fisheries Finance Program (FFP) provides direct loans to the commercial fishing and aquaculture industries. The FFP was developed to provide customers will long term fixed rate financing that is often not available or available only with restrictive terms. The FFP provides long term financing for the cost of construction or reconstruction of fishing vessels, fisheries facilities, aquaculture facilities and the purchase of individual fishing quota in the Northwest Halibut/Sablefish Fishery. The program can under some conditions finance the purchase of used fishing vessels. The program can also refinance existing debt associates with these purposes. The financing of individual fishing quota will soon be expanded to include the Bering Sea Aleutian Island Crab fishery. </p>
<P><STRONG>Eligibility: </strong>Applicants must be in the commercial fishing or aquaculture industries and meet U.S. citizenship requirements. Applicants for fishing quota loans must be eligible to hold such quota shares. All applicants must be credit worthy and have adequate working capital and experience</p>
