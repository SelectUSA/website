<P>Through the U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Program, a company can reduce their production, transaction, and logistics-related costs.</p>
<P>Foreign-trade zones are secure areas under supervision of U.S. Customs and Border Protection that are considered outside the customs territory of the United States for the purposes of duty payment. </p>
<P>Located in or near customs ports of entry, they are the U.S. version of what are known internationally as free trade zones.</p>
<P>The FTZ Program licenses local agencies in all 50 states and Puerto Rico to establish FTZ locations where foreign merchandise can be imported and warehoused. FTZ Program benefits include delayed or reduced payment of duty rates on foreign goods that enter the U.S. market; no duties on imported goods that are later re-exported; reductions in merchandise processing fees because zone users may be able to file a single customs “entry”; elimination of duties on waste, scrap and rejected or defective parts; manufacturing-specific benefits; and, special entry procedures</p>
