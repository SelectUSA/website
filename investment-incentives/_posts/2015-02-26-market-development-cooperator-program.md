<P><STRONG>Incentive:</strong> Market Development Cooperator Program (MDCP) awards include financial and technical assistance from the International Trade Administration (ITA) to support projects that help U.S. companies to export. An MDCP award establishes a partnership between ITA and non-profit industry groups such as trade associations and chambers of commerce. Such groups are particularly effective in reaching small- and medium-size enterprises. The non-profit groups compete for a limited number of MDCP awards by proposing innovative projects that enhance their industry's competitive position. Industry groups pledge to pay a minimum of two-thirds of the project cost and to sustain the project after the MDCP award period ends. On average, projects generate $335 in exports for every $1 of MDCP awards made.</p>
<P><STRONG>Award:</strong> Individual award limit of $300,000. </p>
<P>Funds may be expended over a minimum of three years. The project cannot exceed five years. </p>
<P>The principal measurement of performance is exports generated by MDCP project activity. </p>
<P><STRONG>Eligibility:</strong> Trade Groups, Trade Associations, Chambers of Commerce</p>
