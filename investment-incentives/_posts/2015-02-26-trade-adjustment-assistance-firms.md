<p>Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms (TAAF) is a federal program that provides financial assistance to manufacturers and service firms affected by import competition. Sponsored by the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA), this cost-sharing federal assistance program helps pay for projects that improve firms' competitiveness.</p>
