<P>USTDA is an independent U.S. Government foreign assistance agency that is funded by the U.S. Congress.</p>
<P>Our mission is to help companies create U.S. jobs through the export of U.S. goods and services for priority development projects in emerging economies. </p>
<P>USTDA links U.S. businesses to export opportunities by funding project planning activities, pilot projects, and reverse trade missions while creating sustainable infrastructure and economic growth in partner countries.</p>
<P>USTDA provides grant funding to overseas project sponsors for the planning of projects that support the development of modern infrastructure and an open trading system. The hallmark of USTDA development assistance has always involved building <A href="http://www.ustda.gov/pubs/brochures/USTDA_PublicPrivatePartnerships.pdf"><STRONG>partnerships</strong></a> between U.S. companies and overseas project sponsors to bring proven private sector solutions to developmental challenges.</p>
