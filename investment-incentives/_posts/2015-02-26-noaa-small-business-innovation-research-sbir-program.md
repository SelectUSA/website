<P><STRONG>Incentive:</strong> The NOAA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is part of a Federal-wide program that funds small businesses to do innovation research for Federal agencies (see <A href="http://www.sbir.gov/" target=_top>www.sbir.gov</a>). The objective of the program is to stimulate technological innovation while strengthening the role of small businesses in meeting Federal research needs. The program also seeks to increase the commercial application of innovations derived from SBIR research projects.</p>
<P>The NOAA SBIR program functions are agency-wide.&nbsp; The program is housed in the Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA). ORTA obtains research topics from NOAA scientists and prepares an annual NOAA solicitation based on the research topics received. The annual solicitation opens in mid-October and closes in mid-January each year (see <A href="http://www.oar.noaa.gov/orta" target=_top>www.oar.noaa.gov/orta</a>).&nbsp; </p>
<P><STRONG>Eligibility:</strong> SBIR supports small businesses doing innovative research in meteorology and oceanography on projects identified by NOAA scientists. Commercialization of research results is also an important goal of the program. </p>
