<H2>Trade Missions Program</h2>
<P><STRONG>Department of the Commerce </strong></p>
<P><STRONG>International Trade Administration </strong></p>
<P><STRONG>Incentive:</strong> The International Trade Administration (ITA) Trade Missions Program offers a proven, cost-effective tool for helping U.S. companies learn first-hand about global markets. The Trade Missions Program recruits U.S. companies whose goal is to export their products and services.&nbsp; </p>
<P>These U.S. companies travel together as a delegation on a trade mission where they attend market briefings, participate in site visits and networking receptions, and have one-on-one business matchmaking appointments with pre-screened potential buyers, agents, distributors, and joint venture partners.&nbsp; </p>
<P>ITA Trade Missions gain the attention of local/national government representatives, business leaders and media in international markets. Trade Missions help U.S. companies open markets, leverage opportunities in strategic industries and expand U.S. trade relationships with traditional trading partners, as well as in promising emerging global markets.</p>
<P><STRONG>Eligibility:</strong> Any U.S. company may apply to participate in a trade mission. Companies must certify that the products and services it seeks to export through the mission are either produced in the United States, or, if not, marketed under the name of a U.S. firm and have at least fifty-one percent U.S. content. An applicant must submit a completed and signed application and supplemental application materials, including information on the companyâ€™s products and/or services, primary market objectives, and goals for participation. </p>
