## The Textiles Industry
![Textile spinning room](images/textile-spinning_room-316x238.jpg "Textile Spinning Room")

The U.S. textile industry is one of the more important
employers in the manufacturing sector, with more than 230,000 workers,
representing 2 percent of the U.S. manufacturing workforce. The United States is a
globally competitive manufacturer of textiles, including textile raw materials,
yarns, fabrics, apparel and home furnishings, and other textile finished
products. Our strength is in cotton, manmade fibers, and a wide variety of
yarns and fabrics, including those for apparel and industrial end-uses.

Textile
industry workers are highly skilled and the industry is technologically
advanced, with investments upward of $1.2 billion annually in total capital
expenditures. In recent years, U.S. textile companies have focused on retooling
their businesses, finding more effective work processes, investing in niche
products and markets, and controlling costs. 

The industry is
globally competitive, ranking fourth in global export value behind China, India
and Germany.&nbsp; U.S. exports of textiles
increased by 12 percent between 2010 and 2012, to $17.1 billion.&nbsp; More than 65 percent of U.S. textile exports
go to our free trade agreement partner countries. &nbsp;
