## The Financial Services Industry in the United States

![stock market board](images/exchange_market-347x233.jpg)

Financial markets in the United States are the largest
and most liquid in the world. In 2012, finance and insurance represented 7.9
percent (or $1.24 trillion) of&nbsp;U.S. gross domestic product. Leadership in
this large, high-growth sector translates into substantial economic activity
and direct and indirect job creation in the United States.&nbsp; 

Financial services and products help facilitate and
finance the export of U.S. manufactured goods and agricultural products. In
2011, the United States exported $92.5 billion in financial services and
had&nbsp;a $23.0 billion surplus in financial services and insurance trade
(excluding re-insurance, the financial services and insurance sectors had a
surplus of $59.5 billion.) The financial services and insurance sectors employed
5.87 million people in 2012. The securities subsector of the industry shows
great potential for employment growth, with a 12 percent increase expected by
2018. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 818,000 people were employed
in the securities and investment sector at the end of 2012.

Investment in the U.S. financial services industry offers
significant advantages for financial firms. In 2012, at least 132 of Fortune’s
Global 500 companies have chosen to locate their headquarters in the United States
to take advantage of its creative, competitive, and comprehensive financial
services sector. The industry offers the greatest array of financial
instruments and products to allow consumers to manage risk, create wealth, and
meet financial needs.&nbsp;

## **Industry Subsectors**

**Banking:** As of the end of
2012, the U.S. banking system had $14.45 trillion in assets. It supports the
world’s largest economy with the greatest diversity in banking institutions and
concentration of private credit. In the<sup> </sup>second quarter of 2013,
earnings grew by 23 percent to $42.3 billion, marking the 16<sup>th</sup>
consecutive quarter of rising earnings.

**Asset
Management:**&nbsp; The U.S. asset management subsector is
unrivaled in its depth and diversity. U.S. asset managers are currently meeting
the pension management needs of over 55 percent of the global retirement
market. Total U.S. pension assets were $18.9 trillion at the end of 2012.
Moreover, if insurance assets and mutual funds are included, U.S. asset
managers held more than $39.6 trillion of long-term conventional assets under
management in 2012, or 45% of the global total for these funds.&nbsp;
Conventional funds were equivalent to 298 percent of U.S. GDP.

**Insurance**: In 2012, the
insurance industry’s net premiums written totaled approximately $1.27 billion.
According to the Swiss Reinsurance Company, premiums recorded by life and
health insurers accounted for 45 percent, and premiums by property and casualty
insurers accounted for 55 percent.&nbsp; Additionally, about one-third of all
reinsurance sold worldwide is bought by U.S. firms.

**Venture Capital**: The United
States created the venture capital industry and maintains the oldest and most
dominant position worldwide. In 2012, venture capital-backed companies employed
more than 12 million people and generated nearly $3 trillion in revenue.
Respectively, these figures accounted for 11 percent of private sector
employment and annually VC-backed companies have generated revenue equal to 21
percent of U.S. GDP. (Source: NVCA)
