By all accounts, the 2015 SelectUSA Investment Summit on March 23-24 was a **tremendous success** for the United States and the entrepreneurs who invest in our communities.

We welcomed close to 2,600 participants to Washington this March, including **companies and business associations from 68 international markets** as well as **economic development organizations from all 50 U.S. states**, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam.

During this comprehensive two-day event, delegations of firms from around the world heard from top federal and state officials.

On the international side, a total of 51 U.S. Chiefs of Mission attended the Summit to welcome and support the delegations of firms from their countries.
