By all accounts, the 2015 SelectUSA Investment Summit hosted by President Barack Obama on March 23-24 was a **tremendous success** for the United States and the entrepreneurs who invest in our communities.

## Who was there?

In March 2015, we welcomed participants from more than **70 international markets**, including companies and business associations as well as economic development representatives from all **50 U.S. states**, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. U.S. ambassadors led recruitment, and many personally led high-quality delegations. In an unprecedented show of support for investment attraction, nearly **50 Ambassadors** participated on-site.

## Who spoke?

Participants got the chance to hear from **97 top executives and senior federal and state officials** in plenary and breakout sessions featuring **President Obama, six Cabinet Secretaries, and three Governors**. Global CEOs and other business leaders represented **major international firms** such as Berkshire Hathaway, BMW, Carlyle Group, Google, Michelin, Nestl√©, Nissan, Samsung, Sony, Unilever, and Walmart, as well as entrepreneurs who have successfully grown their **startups and SMEs** in the United States.

## What were the hot topics?

[Discussion]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015-summit/agenda.html) ranged from the **overall advantages of investing in the United States** to expert guidance on investor visas, infrastructure investing, startup resources, workforce development, and more. Hundreds of investors and EDOs also participated in the brand new [SelectUSA Academy]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015-summit/academy.html), an **intensive pre-Summit orientation** on the fundamentals of investing and promoting investment in the United States.

## And how about the networking?

During this comprehensive two-day event, participants used the online matchmaking system to coordinate more than **1,700 business meetings**; many more meetings were facilitated by the U.S. Commercial Service and EDOs.  The **72,000-sq ft Exhibit Hall** was filled with economic developers, service providers, and government officials from the federal, state and local levels, showcasing investment opportunities from every corner of the United States.
