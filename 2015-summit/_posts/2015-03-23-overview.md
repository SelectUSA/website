By all accounts, the 2015 SelectUSA Investment Summit hosted by President Barack Obama on March 23-24 was a **tremendous success** for the United States and the entrepreneurs who invest in our communities.

We welcomed close to **2,600 participants** to Washington this March, including companies and business associations from **68 international markets** as well as economic development organizations (EDOs) from **all 50 U.S. states**, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. A total of **51 U.S. Ambassadors and Chiefs of Mission** attended the Summit to welcome and support their delegations.

During this comprehensive two-day event, SelectUSA facilitated **more than 1,700 business matchmaking meetings** between firms, state and local EDOs, service providers, and federal officials. Many more impromptu meetings took place in the **72,000-sq ft Exhibit Hall**, which showcased investment opportunities from every corner of the United States.

Participants got the chance to hear from **97 global CEOs and top federal and state officials** in the plenary and breakout sessions, featuring **President Obama, six Cabinet Secretaries, three Governors,** and top executives from **major international firms** such as BMW, Carlyle Group, Google, Michelin, Nestle, Nissan, Samsung, Sony, Unilever, and Walmart, as well as entrepreneurs who have successfully grown their **startups and SMEs** in the United States.

[Topics of discussion]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015-summit/agenda.html) ranged from the **overall advantages** of investing in the United States to **expert guidance** on investor visas, infrastructure investing, startup resources, workforce development, and more. Hundreds of investors and EDOs also participated in the brand new **SelectUSA Academy**, an intense pre-Summit orientation on the fundamentals of investing and promoting investment in the United States.

The feedback we received from participants was **overwhelmingly positive**, and SelectUSA looks forward to working with many investor and EDO clients in the months ahead.
