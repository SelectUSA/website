By all accounts, the 2015 SelectUSA Investment Summit hosted by President Barack Obama on March 23-24 was a **tremendous success** for the United States and the entrepreneurs who invest in our communities.

We welcomed close to 2,600 participants to Washington this March, including **companies and business associations from 68 international markets** as well as **economic development organizations (EDOs) from all 50 U.S. states**, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam.

During this comprehensive two-day event, SelectUSA facilitated **more than 1,700 business matchmaking meetings** between firms, state and local EDOs, service providers, and federal officials. Many more impromptu meetings took place in the **72,000-sq ft Exhibit Hall**, which showcased investment opportunities from every corner of the United States.

Participants also heard from **global CEOs and top federal and state officials** on a [wide variety of topics]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015-summit/agenda.html), from the overall benefits of investing in the United States to expert guidance on investor visas, intellectual property, resources for startups, and much more.

**Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker** kicked off the Summit with welcome remarks, and later **President Obama** 

In the [keynote address on Tuesday]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015-summit/plenary_session_videos.html#kerry), **Secretary of State John Kerry** emphasized the State Department's important role in supporting foreign direct investment in the United States. A total of **51 U.S. Ambassadors and Chiefs of Mission** attended the Summit to welcome and support their delegations. 

The feedback we received from participants was **overwhelmingly positive**, and SelectUSA looks forward to working with many investor and EDO clients throughout the year.
