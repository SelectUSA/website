<span>In 2012, the U.S. aerospace
industry contributed $118.5 billion in export sales to the U.S. economy.&nbsp;
The industry’s positive trade balance of $70.5 billion is the largest trade
surplus of any manufacturing industry and came from exporting 64.3 percent of
all aerospace production.</span>

<span>Foreign firms are attracted to
the U.S. aerospace market because it is the largest in the world and has a
skilled and hospitable workforce, extensive distribution systems, diverse
offerings, and strong support at the local and national level for policy and
promotion.&nbsp; According to a recent study by the U.S. Department of Commerce,
aerospace exports directly and indirectly support more jobs than the export of
any other commodity.&nbsp; The U.S. aerospace
industry directly employs about 500,000 workers in scientific and technical
jobs across the nation and supports more than 700,000 jobs in related
fields.&nbsp; Investment&nbsp;in the U.S. aerospace industry is facilitated by
a large pool of well-trained machinists, aerospace engineers, and other
highly-skilled workers with experience in the aerospace industry.</span>

<span>Industry estimates indicate that
the annual increase in the number of large commercial airplanes during the next
20 years will be 3.5 percent per year for a total of 34,000 valued at $4.5
trillion (list prices). &nbsp;</span>

## Industry Subsectors

**<span>Large Civil Aircraft
(LCA) – </span>**<span>The United
States is a global leader in LCA production and offers many opportunities for
investment in the LCA supply chain.</span>

**<span>Rotorcraft –</span>**<span> The U.S. rotorcraft industry is diverse
with the bulk of new deliveries arriving from mature production lines.&nbsp;
The market encompasses military, emergency medical service (EMS) providers,
offshore oil and gas exploration, and law enforcement applications.&nbsp; </span>

**<span>Commercial Space –</span>**<span> The companies in the U.S. commercial
space market are major suppliers to U.S. Government programs, where demand has
remained stable during the commercial aerospace and global economic downturns.</span>

**<span>General Aviation (GA) –</span>**<span> The United States is the world’s largest
market for GA aircraft.&nbsp; U.S. manufacturers produce a wide range of GA
products including piston aircraft, turboprops, jets, balloons, dirigibles, and
experimental aircraft.</span>

**<span>Engines -</span>**<span> Major engine and power plant
manufacturers are typically part of diversified corporations producing engines
for both civil and military aircraft, either alone or as part of one or more
joint ventures.&nbsp; Engines and power plant sales also provide maintenance,
repair and overhaul business opportunities.</span>

**<span>Unmanned Aircraft Systems
(UAS) -</span>**<span> Given the
rapid growth of military and civil governmental UAS operations, there is
tremendous potential for the U.S. industry in the evolving commercial UAS sector.&nbsp; Moreover, the November 2013 release of the
FAA’s “Roadmap for Integration of Civil Unmanned Aircraft Systems into the
National Airspace” and the interagency-backed “UAS Comprehensive Plan” (along
with the release of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Small UAS and the
announcement of the six U.S. UAS test sites targeted for 2014) demonstrate the
U.S. Government’s commitment to supporting civilian UAS development. </span>

**<span>Airport
Infrastructure/Aviation Security -</span>**<span> Airport infrastructure and aviation security
markets continue to grow both in the United States and abroad.&nbsp; At the 38<sup>th</sup>
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in the fall of 2013,
the Assembly formally endorsed the proposed Aviation System Block Upgrade
(ASBU) roadmaps for modernization of the global aviation system.&nbsp; The ICAO ASBUs provide a rational framework
for planning of air traffic management upgrades in the future that emphasizes
harmonization of technology and procedures.&nbsp;
U.S. companies are poised to implement solutions that meet these new
requirements.</span>

<span>Along with infrastructure growth,
the evolving security needs both within the United States and throughout the
world are driving demand for aviation security technologies.&nbsp; The 38<sup>th</sup>
ICAO Assembly also addressed aviation security with the hope of establishing a
global baseline.&nbsp; This baseline would
include the implementation of risk-based security, the sustainability of
security measures, and air cargo and mail security.&nbsp; Similarly, the U.S. Transportation Security
Administration has embraced risk-based security as a means of addressing
security needs in an efficient and effective manner.</span>

**<span>Alternative Aviation
Fuels –</span>**<span> Demand for
alternative fuels in the aviation sector is increasing due to the price
volatility of traditional jet fuel, and concerns about the effect of aviation
on the environment. &nbsp;The United States is a leader in alternative aviation
fuel research and development, and U.S. producers have successfully completed test
flights using fuels from a variety of feedstock. &nbsp;These fuel producers are
actively seeking investment as they move towards commercial production.</span>

**<span>Supply Chain -</span>**<span> The United States has a robust aerospace
supply chain with capabilities in maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO),
composites, metal-working, avionics, testing equipment, and coatings.&nbsp;
U.S.-based suppliers are highly sought after partners for aerospace
manufacturing programs at home and abroad.</span>

## Federal Programs and Recent or Pending Legislation

**<span>The National Space
Policy:</span>**<span> President
Obama’s June 2010 National Space Policy puts a strong emphasis on the use of
commercial space capabilities and international cooperation to meet U.S.
Government mission requirements.&nbsp; This will give U.S. commercial space companies
the opportunity to provide new services to the government, such as
transportation of cargo to the International Space Station as well as human
transport for exploration.&nbsp; The Administration is conducting an ongoing
review of related sectoral policies on space transportation, satellite remote
sensing and space-based positioning, navigation, and timing.&nbsp; The review
is intended to ensure that those guidelines reflect the National Space Policy’s
objectives, such as industry competitiveness and increased international
cooperation. &nbsp;</span>

**<span>National Aeronautics
Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Policy:</span>**<span> This policy guides federal aeronautical R&amp;D
activities to promote long-term sustainable research on advanced aircraft
systems and air transportation management systems and infrastructure.&nbsp; The
policy aims to foster a vibrant and dynamic R&amp;D community that includes
government, industry, and academia.</span>

**<span>Export Control Reform:</span>**<span> The Obama administration and Congress are
implementing reforms of export control regulations that will create a more
predictable, efficient, and transparent technology control regime.&nbsp; The reforms will create a single control
list, a single primary enforcement coordination agency, a single information
technology system, and a single licensing agency.&nbsp; These reforms will help
facilitate exports of U.S.-based aerospace manufacturers.</span>
