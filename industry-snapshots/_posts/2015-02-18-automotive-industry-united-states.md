The United States
has one of the largest automotive markets in the world and is home to 13 auto
manufacturers. &nbsp;From 2008 to 2012, manufacturers produced an average of
over 8 million passenger vehicles annually in the United States. &nbsp;

Since
Honda opened its first U.S. plant in 1982, almost every major European,
Japanese, and Korean automaker has produced vehicles at one or more U.S.
assembly plants.&nbsp; In addition to Honda
and the big three U.S. auto companies - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -
Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai-Kia, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Mazda, Mitsubishi, and Subaru
all have U.S. manufacturing facilities.&nbsp;
In May 2011, Volkswagen opened a new U.S. plant, bringing the manufacturer
count to 13.&nbsp; In addition, many manufacturers also have engine and
transmission plants and are conducting research and development, design, and
testing in the United States.&nbsp; The
automotive industry, including dealerships accounts for approximately 3.5
percent of U.S. gross domestic product.&nbsp;
Motor vehicles and parts manufacturers directly employed 786,000 people at the end of 2012.&nbsp; 

There is an
extensive network of auto parts suppliers serving the industry.&nbsp; Suppliers produced $225.2
billion in industry shipments in 2012, accounting for nearly 4 percent of total U.S.
manufacturing.&nbsp; According to a study by
the Motor &amp; Equipment Manufacturers Association in collaboration with
Information Handling Services, the total employment impact of the auto parts
industry was estimated at over 3.62
million jobs directly and indirectly nationwide in 2012 - more jobs
and economic wellbeing than any other manufacturing sector. 

Despite challenges
within the industry in recent years, the U.S. automotive sector is at the
forefront of innovation.&nbsp; New research and development initiatives are
transforming the industry to better respond to the opportunities of the 21<sup>st</sup>
century. 

In 2012, the
United States exported approximately 2.6 million vehicles valued at $63 billion
to more than 200 countries around the world, with additional exports of
automotive parts valued at approximately $75 billion.&nbsp; With an open investment
policy, a large consumer market, a highly skilled workforce, available
infrastructure, and government incentives, the United States is the premier
place for the future of the auto industry.&nbsp;
