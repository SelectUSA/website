<span class="imgright">![woman with shopping bags at mall]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/shopping_mall-338x260_0-225x173.jpg "woman with shopping bags at mall")</span>The United
States has well-established distribution channels for all types of retail
companies. The retail services industry provides an openly competitive
environment that fosters strong business operations and spurs innovations that
increase efficiency and reliability. 

Total sales
from the more than 3.6 million retail establishments in the United States
reached about $2.5 trillion in 2012, and retailers supported more than 42
million jobs in the U.S. According to the National Retail Federation, retail
industry sales for 2013 are expected to increase 3.4 percent from 2012. 

Numerous
opportunities for growth exist in the U.S. retail market for retail providers
of all sizes, including individual direct marketers or direct sellers, small-
to medium-sized franchise unit owners, and large “big-box” store operators. New
distribution companies are opening stores and units daily to serve a large,
affluent consumer base.&nbsp;

## **Industry Subsectors**

**Retailers**: This subsector employs approximately one out of five Americans. According to the National Retail Federation, independent and privately held retail businesses account for about 95 percent of the retail industry. 

**Franchisers**: Franchising has provided business opportunities in the United States for more than 150 years. The model is widely embraced because it provides an established plan for business expansion and a means of spreading risk. Franchising also offers assistance and support for new business owners by passing on a proven business model, along with training and support, advertising programs, accounting and payroll management, and discounted group rates for employee health insurance.&nbsp;
