U.S. machinery industries had total domestic and foreign sales of $413.7 billion in 2011.<span class="imgright">![conveyor belt with dollar bills]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manufacturing-301x377.jpg)</span>&nbsp;The United States is the world’s largest market for machinery, as well as the third-largest supplier.&nbsp; American manufacturers held a 58.5 percent share of the U.S. domestic market.

U.S. manufacturers’ commitment to technological innovation is key to their continued leadership in a highly competitive global marketplace. Application of information technology to machinery to achieve greater productivity, efficiency, and sustainability is critical. In addition, numerous American universities are engaged in advanced research in related engineering and scientific disciplines that contribute to competitive U.S. machinery industries.

Machinery and
equipment manufacturing industries provide essential and highly sophisticated
technology for many other manufacturing and service industries. Process control
and other automation technologies enable end-users to maximize the productivity
of their equipment.&nbsp; Sales of many types of machinery typically are
accompanied by a variety of high-value services, including specialized
architecture, engineering, and logistics.

More than 1.3
million Americans were employed directly in manufacturing machinery and
equipment in August 2013.&nbsp; These jobs are almost entirely in high-skill,
well-compensated professions and trades.&nbsp;&nbsp; Machinery manufacturing
also supports the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Americans in a variety of
other manufacturing and service industries.

Thousands of
U.S. companies manufacture machinery and equipment.&nbsp; Most are SMEs, but
there are also many large, publically traded firms and iconic American brands
that do business on a global scale. Machinery and equipment is manufactured
throughout the United States, but is concentrated in the industrial
Midwest.&nbsp; California and Texas are also important locales for machinery
industries.

U.S. machinery and
equipment manufacturing industries are also strong and consistent
exporters.&nbsp; In 2012, U.S. machinery industries reported exports worth $184.0
billion, an increase of 6.2 percent over 2011, and recorded a $9 billion trade surplus.&nbsp;
Many machinery manufacturers find the United States to be a premier location to
manufacture for export to neighboring markets like Canada and Mexico.

## **Industry Subsectors**

**Agricultural
and Food Machinery and Equipment:** Equipment used to grow, process, package, transport, and
distribute food and beverages.&nbsp; Agricultural and Food Machinery and
Equipment includes agricultural equipment, food processing and packaging
machinery, commercial and industrial refrigeration equipment, and commercial
food service equipment.

**Construction Machinery
and Related Equipment:**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction and mining equipment and
related systems.&nbsp; This subsector includes self-propelled equipment,
implements, accessories and components for use in construction, forestry,
mining and utilities. Off-road diesel engines and fluid-power technology are
also important components of off-road equipment.

**Manufacturing Machinery:** Machinery and
equipment used to manufacture a wide range of goods out of metal and plastic.
Manufacturing Machinery consists of technologies that find application in many
other manufacturing industries, such as automotive, aerospace and medical
devices. It includes machine tools for cutting, stamping and forming metal;
plastics and rubber manufacturing machinery; and a wide range of cutting tools,
dies and accessories.

**Industrial
Process Machinery:** Equipment and technology used in a wide range of industries to operate and
automate industrial processes.&nbsp; Industrial process technology includes
basic products such as electric motors, pumps, valves and compressors and
industrial controls, as well as material handling equipment.&nbsp; Process
control systems are especially important to achieving the greatest productivity
from industrial plant and equipment.

**Power and
Energy Equipment:** Equipment and machinery for generating, transmitting and distributing
electric power as well as machinery used for oil and gas exploration and
production.&nbsp; Major categories include turbines, power transmission
equipment and internal combustion engines (except automotive gasoline and
aircraft) for electric utility and industrial applications.&nbsp; Also includes
oil and gas field machinery.&nbsp;
