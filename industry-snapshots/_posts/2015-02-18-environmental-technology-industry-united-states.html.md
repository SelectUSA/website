The United States is the largest single producer of environmental technologies in the world, representing nearly 40 percent of the $782 billion global market. According to Environmental Business International, Inc., approximately 117,000 enterprises and 1.7 million workers make up the U.S. environmental technology industry. In 2008, the industry produced $278 billion in revenue, with 47 percent from services, 21 percent from equipment; and 32 percent from resources. 

Small- and medium-sized businesses account for approximately 99 percent of the industry and generate approximately 20 percent of the total revenue. Large companies represent only 1 percent of private sector activity, yet account for 49 percent of revenue. Public-sector municipalities and similar entities make up the remaining 31 percent and dominate water utilities, wastewater treatment works and solid waste management. 

&nbsp;The U.S. environmental technology industry has undergone significant restructuring and consolidation but has experienced growth over the past 10 years. Change of ownership and structure within environmental technology businesses is expected to continue, particularly in the water sector.
