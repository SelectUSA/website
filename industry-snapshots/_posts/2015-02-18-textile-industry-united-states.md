## The Textiles Industry
<span class="imgright">![Textile spinning room]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/textile-spinning_room-316x238.jpg "Textile Spinning Room")</span>

The U.S. textile industry is one of the more important employers in the manufacturing sector, with 232,000 workers, representing 2 percent of the U.S. manufacturing workforce. The United States is a globally competitive manufacturer of textiles, including textile raw materials, yarns, fabrics, apparel and home furnishings, and other textile finished products. Our strength is in cotton, manmade fibers, and a wide variety of yarns and fabrics, including those for apparel and industrial end-uses.

Textile industry workers are highly skilled and the industry is technologically advanced, with investments of $1.6 billion in total capital expenditures in 2013. In recent years, U.S. textile companies have focused on retooling their businesses, finding more effective work processes, investing in niche products and markets, and controlling costs.

The industry is globally competitive, ranking fourth in global export value behind China, India, and Germany.  U.S. exports of textiles increased by 45 percent between 2009 and 2014, to $18.3 billion.  More than 65 percent of U.S. textile exports go to our free trade agreement partner countries.
