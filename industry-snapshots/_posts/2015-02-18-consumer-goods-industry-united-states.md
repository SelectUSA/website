<span>The U.S. companies that make up
the consumer goods industry are as varied as the subsectors within the
industry. Opportunities exist for both large and small companies across the
spectrum of subsectors that make up the consumer products landscape.&nbsp;Because the U.S. market is broad and open, the
typical U.S. consumer is receptive to both domestic and imported brands.&nbsp;</span>

Industry subsectors include
appliances, toys, furniture and home furnishings, recreational boats,
recreational vehicles (RVs), motorcycles, games, gifts, greeting cards, school
and office products, jewelry, sporting goods, musical instruments, processed
foods, and beverages, including water, juices, beer, wine, spirits, and all
non-alcoholic beverages.&nbsp;<span>en, the typical U.S. consumer is receptive to
