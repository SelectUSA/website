## Régitex USA Opens U.S. Manufacturing Plant

Régitex USA LLC, a Canadian-based manufacturer of made-to-order ring spun and open end yarns, announced in July a $1.5 million investment in the opening of a U.S. manufacturing plant in Mecklenburg County, Virginia.&nbsp;

>_- Rick Martignetti, president of Régitex USA LLC._

Virginia’s skilled and motivated workforce, transportation facilities, low-energy costs and location were influential factors in the organization’s decision to locate in the United States and Mecklenburg County. 

Régitex USA will acquire and upgrade an existing textile plant to produce leading-edge yarns for the industrial, apparel, high-performance and home furnishing markets.&nbsp; The investment is expected to create 60 new jobs in the U.S.
