## NCR Observes Competitive Advantage from Manufacturing in USA

<span class="imgright">![NCR Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}/images/ncr-logo_pantone.jpg)</span>In June 2009, American technology company NCR Corp. selected two locations in Georgia as sites for its worldwide headquarters and a new North American manufacturing plant. The moves were expected to create an estimated 1,250 jobs in Duluth, Georgia, and 870 jobs in Columbus, Georgia.

>**“Our decision to bring our North American ATM manufacturing in-house was driven by our belief that as self-service ATM technology becomes more innovative and strategic to financial institutions, the ability to control manufacturing in key markets becomes a core and competitive advantage to our growth strategy...**
>
>**NCR recognized that by in-sourcing their production, they would be able to decrease time-to-market, improve their internal collaboration, and lower their operating costs.”**

>_- Peter Dorsman, NCR Senior Vice President of Global Operations_

NCR chose to invest in the United States and Georgia because of its pro-business environment and outstanding education and workforce development initiatives.&nbsp;
