## Bombardier Investment Takes Off

In April 2012, Bombardier Aerospace [held a groundbreaking ceremony](http://www.kansas.com/2012/04/30/2317009/bombardier-learjet-breaks-ground.html) in Wichita, KS as part of a $600 million investment to expand its Learjet facility. The project will accommodate new aircraft programs and research facilities, giving the site a role in the entire Bombardier Aerospace product portfolio. This expansion includes the growth of Bombardier's Flight Test Center, the creation of a Bombardier Center of Excellence in Engineering and Information Technology, a new production flight building, a new paint building, and a new delivery center. This expansion will also serve Bombardier’s newest Learjet 85 aircraft platform, which[ started its flight test program](http://www.avionics-intelligence.com/articles/2014/04/learjet-flight-test.html) in April 2014.

The total value of the investment is more than $600 million and is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs over seven to ten years.
