##Astrum Solar Expands U.S. Operations

In April 2010, Astrum Solar – an installer of residential and small commercial solar panels headquartered in Annapolis Junction, Maryland – announced the opening of <span class="imgright">![Astrum Solar Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}/images/as_logo-rgb-250px-176x192.jpg)</span>a new office outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The new office was opened in response to growing demand for sustainable and cost-effective energy solutions and to service the region’s growing customer base. &nbsp;

> **“The expansion in&nbsp;Pennsylvania&nbsp;is just one part of Astrum Solar's aggressive growth strategy to serve new geographic markets up and down the East Coast."**

The Pennsylvania office employs 25 people in the fields of engineering, sales, installation, and project management and is expected to continue to grow with consumer demand. In addition to serving customers in eastern Pennsylvania, the new office is also expected to provide installations for residents in south New Jersey.
