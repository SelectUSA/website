## Caterpillar selects United States for New Manufacturing Facilities

In August 2012, Caterpillar [started operations](http://www.areadevelopment.com/newsitems/8-24-2012/caterpillar-hydraulic-plant-victoria-texas-3455671.shtml) at its $200 million&nbsp;manufacturing plant in Victoria, Texas. The state-of-the-art facility will focus on the manufacture of hydraulic excavators and created 225 jobs. 

> **“Based on our comprehensive review of possible locations, Victoria’s proximity to our supply base, access to ports and other transportation, as well as the positive business climate in Texas made this the ideal site for this project.**
>
>**Caterpillar is committed to maintaining its global leadership position in the excavator industry, and this new facility in Texas will play an important role in our long-term plans to provide customers in every region of the world with the products and solutions they need to help them with their businesses.”**
> 
> _- Gary Stampanato, Caterpillar Vice President responsible for excavators_

The facility is expected to triple the current capacity of hydraulic excavators produced by Caterpillar in the United States and double the number of Caterpillar employees making excavators in the United States.&nbsp;

In October 2013, Caterpillar continued expanding its U.S. operations by [opening a factory in Athens, GA](http://www.ajc.com/news/business/new-athens-plant-key-to-caterpillar/nbdcg/) for “small-track” bulldozers and mini hydraulic excavators.

Caterpillar plans to hire as many as 1,400 workers, and the plant is expected to be fully operational and staffed by 2015. According to CEO <span>Doug Oberhelman,</span>&nbsp;about 2,800 more jobs could follow from Caterpillar suppliers that are expected to locate near the new plant.
