## Intel Keeps Pace with $6 to $8 Billion in U.S. Plant Expansions and Upgrades

Intel announced in October 2010 plans to invest between $6 billion and $8 billion on next-generation manufacturing technology in its U.S. facilities over the next several years. The investment includes the development of a new fabrication plant in Oregon and upgrades to four existing factories in Arizona and Oregon to produce chips with circuits 22 nanometers wide, smaller than their current generation of chips.

> **“Today’s announcement reflects the next tranche of the continued advancement of Moore’s Law and a further commitment to invest in the future of Intel and America.**
>
>**The most immediate impact of our multi-billion-dollar investment will be the thousands of jobs associated with building a new fab and upgrading four others, and the high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that follow.”**
>
>_- Paul Otellini, Intel President and CEO_

The new plant and upgrades are expected to support 6,000 to 8,000 construction jobs and result in 800 to 1,000 new, permanent high-tech jobs, as well as help Intel maintain its current manufacturing base at these U.S. sites.
