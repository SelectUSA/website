Whirlpool Corporation, a leading manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances, announced plans in September to invest $120 million in a new 1 million-square-foot manufacturing facility in Cleveland, Tennessee.

The new manufacturing facility represents the largest single investment Whirlpool has ever made anywhere in the world, reinforcing Whirlpool’s commitment to the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing, Fettig said.&nbsp; The company expects the project to create 130 new U.S. jobs. 

Whirlpool considered other sites in Mexico before ultimately choosing the United States and Cleveland for its employee training opportunities and experience in lean manufacturing.
