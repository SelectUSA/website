## Vestas Invests Nearly $1 Billion in U.S. Manufacturing Facilities

Denmark-based Vestas, the leading provider of high-tech wind power systems, has invested nearly $1 billion in the United States and Colorado since 2007. In 2010, Vestas opened a fourth manufacturing plant in Brighton, Colorado. The new factory is a nacelle and hub manufacturing plant. The plant initially employed 280 employees, and Vestas announced that an additional 1,000 employees would be hired to staff the other three factories in Brighton, Windsor and Pueblo.

>**â€œWe are ramping up and investing in the U.S. because we have a high confidence in the U.S. market as one of the most important wind markets on this planet."**

>_- Michael Holm, Vestas spokesman_

With all Colorado plants fully functioning, they will employ over 2,500 workers statewide and will contribute to a nearly $700 million capital investment in the State of Colorado._&nbsp;_
